### Programming Problem Notes

 For each programming problem, let us know:
	- To compile and run use:
		`make all`
		`./amazon database.txt` 
 - Design decisions you made or other non-trivial choices for your implementation
	- to use maps for users and products so that it made looking up each of those easier and faster in the mydatastore.h file 
	- to use a vector for the carts in amazon.cpp because it could maintain a fifo, but we could loop through unlike a queue
